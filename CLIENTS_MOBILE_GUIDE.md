## Troubleshooting

### "Can't connect to server"

- Verify the IP address from your IT team
- Example: `http://192.168.1.50`
- Don't include `http://` if typing in address bar

**Solution 2:** Check network connection
- Make sure phone is on company WiFi
- Or verify VPN is connected
- Don't use personal mobile data unless configured

**Solution 3:** Try reloading
- Pull to refresh (iOS)
- Swipe down and refresh (Android)
- Wait 10 seconds and try again

### "Page looks strange" or "Text too small"

**Solution:** Pinch to zoom
- Pinch outward to zoom in
- Pinch inward to zoom out
- Double-tap to auto-fit

### "Page is slow"

**Solution:** Check your connection
- Strong WiFi: 2+ bars
- Fast 4G: 3+ bars
- 3G or poor WiFi: May be slow, reload after 10 seconds

### "Button won't click"

**Solution:** Tap the center
- All buttons work with a single tap
- Try tapping the middle of the button
- Not a long-press or double-tap

## Best Practices for Mobile

✅ **Do:**
- Use the same WiFi as the server for best performance
- Keep your phone in portrait mode (unless viewing charts)
- Tap buttons once (not multiple times)
- Close other tabs to save battery
- Bookmark for quick access

❌ **Don't:**
- Don't use mobile data if WiFi is available (uses less battery)
- Don't rotate phone to landscape for every page (unless needed)
- Don't keep the screen on longer than needed
- Don't use small font zoom permanently (hard to read)

---

## Network Requirements

**WiFi Connection:**
- Same network as server (same building)
- Speed: 5+ Mbps recommended
- Can work on slower networks (may be slower)

**Mobile Data:**
- Only if VPN or Domain access is set up
- Uses 1-10MB per session
- Ask your IT team about data usage

**Offline:**
- Currently not supported
- Always need connection to server

---

## Battery Tips for Mobile

- **Portrait mode uses less battery** than constant WiFi scanning
- **Reduce screen brightness:** Display is the biggest power drain
- **Close unused browser tabs:** Reduces memory and processing
- **Disable location services:** You don't need it for ShadowOps
- **Use battery saver mode** if available

**Typical Usage:**
- 1 hour on WiFi: ~5-10% battery
- 8 hours on WiFi: ~30-40% battery (with normal use)
