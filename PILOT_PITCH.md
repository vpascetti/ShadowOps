# ShadowOps - Pilot Customer Pitch

**Exclusive Q1 2025 Pilot Program**

---

## The One-Liner

**ShadowOps is a real-time intelligence layer that makes any manufacturing ERP smarter—without replacing it.**

---

## The Problem (That Every Manufacturer Has)

Your plant loses millions every year because:

1. **Your ERP is blind in real-time**
   - Data is 4-24 hours old
   - Requires manual exports and reports
   - Problems discovered after they happen

2. **Supervisors are reactive, not strategic**
   - Spend hours creating reports
   - Make decisions based on gut feel
   - Can't see what's coming

3. **Late jobs cascade**
   - One late job affects 5 others
   - Customer complaints and expedite fees
   - Overtime and rushed quality

4. **Hidden inefficiencies**
   - Bottlenecks invisible until too late
   - Scrap trends spotted weeks late
   - Poor schedule adherence

**Conservative estimate: $500K - $2M/year in preventable losses for a mid-sized plant.**

---

## The ShadowOps Solution

### What It Does
- **Real-time plant visibility**: See every job, every machine, every bottleneck—now
- **Proactive alerts**: Know about problems before they become fires
- **AI-driven prioritization**: Tell every work center what to run next
- **Works with any ERP**: IQMS, DELMIAWorks, Epicor, Plex, NetSuite—doesn't matter

### What It Doesn't Do
- Replace your ERP (your investment is safe)
- Require 18-month implementations
- Lock you into one vendor's ecosystem
- Cost $500K+ like traditional MES systems

## Core Features (Live Demo in 15 Minutes)

### 1. Executive Briefing Dashboard
**For: Plant Managers, COO, CEO**

One screen shows:
- Total jobs in plant
- How many are late, at risk, on track
- Top 10 critical alerts
- Which work centers are bottlenecks

**Value:** Skip the morning report meeting. Know plant health in 30 seconds.

### 2. Smart Alerts
**For: Production Supervisors, Planners**

Automatic detection of:
- Late jobs (already past due)
- At-risk jobs (schedule vs. progress gap >25%)
- Projected late jobs (AI prediction based on current pace)
- Scrap spikes, cycle time variance, idle time excess

**Value:** Fix problems proactively instead of firefighting reactively.

### 3. Priority Run Lists
**For: Work Center Operators, Supervisors**

Each work center gets a prioritized queue based on:
- Due dates
- Current progress
- Risk scores
- Downstream dependencies

**Value:** Eliminate "what should I run next?" decisions. Reduce late jobs by 40%.

### 4. Time-Travel Analysis
**For: CI Teams, Root Cause Analysis**

Rewind plant state to any past date:
- "What did the plant look like 2 weeks ago?"
- "Why was Job X late?"
- "How would delaying this order impact everything?"

**Value:** Learn from history. Plan scenarios. Justify decisions with data.

## Target Customers (Ideal Pilot Profile)

✅ **Manufacturing plants with:**
- 50-500 employees
- $10M - $200M annual revenue
- Existing ERP (any vendor)
- 5-20 work centers
- Mix of job shop + repetitive manufacturing
- Pain with late jobs and schedule adherence

✅ **Champions inside the plant:**
- Plant Manager (feels the pain daily)
- Operations Manager (desperate for better tools)
- COO (wants data-driven decisions)
- CTO (open to modern solutions)

❌ **Not a fit (yet):**
- <10 employees (too small)
- Pure assembly line (different problem)
- Happy with current ERP (rare!)
- No budget authority (waste of time)

## Objection Handling

### "We already have an ERP."
**Response:** "Perfect! ShadowOps works on top of your ERP. We don't replace it—we enhance it. Think of us as a heads-up display for your existing system."

### "We can't afford new software right now."
**Response:** "The pilot is $2,500/month. If you have even 5 late jobs per month, you're already losing more than that. This pays for itself in Week 1."

### "Our IT team is too busy."
**Response:** "That's exactly why we built ShadowOps. No IT project required. We can ingest a CSV export from your ERP today. IT doesn't even need to be involved in the pilot."

### "We tried something like this before and it failed."
**Response:** "What failed before—and why? Most failures happen because: (1) took too long to implement, (2) required changing processes, or (3) didn't integrate with ERP. ShadowOps addresses all three: live in 2 weeks, no process changes required, works with any ERP."

### "We need to think about it."
**Response:** "Totally understand. What's your decision timeline? Would a 1-hour working session with your team help? I can bring the demo to your plant and show it on your actual data."

### "Can you come back in 6 months?"
**Response:** "Of course. Just know that pilot slots are limited—we're only taking 5 customers in Q1. If you're not ready, no problem. Can I follow up in March to see if timing is better then?"

---

## Call to Action

### For Initial Contact:
"I'd love to show you a 15-minute demo of ShadowOps in action. No sales pitch—just a live walkthrough of the product with real manufacturing data. When's a good time this week?"

### After Demo:
"Based on what you've seen, does this solve problems you're currently facing? If yes, I'd like to get you into our Q1 pilot program. We have 2 slots left."

### To Close:
"To get started, we just need a signed pilot agreement and the first month's payment ($2,500). I'll send the agreement over today. Can we target a kickoff call next Monday?"
